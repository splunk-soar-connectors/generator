    <p>
    This app will generate sample, semi-random data to be ingested at regular polling intervals. To configure, create a new asset, and choose vendor "Generic" and product "Generator".
    </p>
    <p>
<h2>Poll Now</h2>
    <p>
    Poll now can be used to immediately ingest the specified number of events, which will contain the specified number of artifacts in each.
    </p>
<h2>Scheduled Polling</h2>
    <p>
    This allows artifacts and events to be generated at the specified polling intervals automatically. 
    </p>
<h2>Generated artifact modification: Custom data source files</h2>
    <p>
    Create a file in <b>/opt/phantom/apps/data/generator_48f16006-fee0-44fa-89b0-0106c0618527/</b> with a useful name, such as "newdata.txt". If the path doesn't exist, make sure to complete an initial "Poll Now" with the app to initialize it.<br>
    Ensure that the file permissions are correct: chown phantom-worker.phantom.<Br>
    In your generator asset's "asset settings" configuration, set the field "Artifact Data File" to the filename, ie "newdata.txt".
    The file should contain on each line a valid json dictionary containing CEF sample data.  Items are chosen from this file to fill the various CEF fields.  If you want to make sure specific CEF fields appear in an artifact together, simply create a json dictionary on one line that contains all the CEF fields and their values.
    If you want to add more random data without correlating it to other CEF fields just add a simple json dictionary with one CEF field and its value.
    <br>
    <br>Example/default data file: <a href="/app_resource/generator_48f16006-fee0-44fa-89b0-0106c0618527/inc/artifact_dump.txt">artifact_dump.txt</a> 
    </p>
    <p><b>Correlated data example (all three CEF fields will randomly appear in an artifact, possibly with additional generated CEF data):</b>
    <pre>{"cs1": "30968", "cs1Label": "asn", "destinationAddress": "77.221.140.99"}
    </pre>
    </P>
    <p><b>Simple data example (the defined CEF field will randomly appear in an artifact, possibly with other generated CEF data):</b>
    <pre>{"destinationAddress": "253.207.67.115"}
    </pre>
    </P>
<h2>Generated artifact modification: Data lines per artifact</h2>
	<p>
	The Min/Max data lines per artifact parameter allows you more control over combinations of CEF fields placed into an artifact. Generator will try to create artifacts using a random number (between min and max) of lines in the selected source data file.  As described above, each line can contain one or more CEF fields.
	</p>
<h2>Modifying randomized event (container) names</h2>
    <p>
    Create a file in <b>/opt/phantom/apps/data/generator_48f16006-fee0-44fa-89b0-0106c0618527/</b> with a useful name, such as "event_names.txt". If the path doesn't exist, make sure to complete an initial "Poll Now" with the app to initialize it.<br>
    Ensure that the file permissions are correct: chown phantom-worker.phantom.<Br>
    In your generator asset's "asset settings" configuration, set the field "Event Name File" to the filename, ie "event_names.txt".
    The file should contain a list of phrases or words that you would like the app to randomly pull from in order to have more selectable event (container) names that are specific to your needs.
    <br>
    <br>Example/default data file: <a href="/app_resource/generator_48f16006-fee0-44fa-89b0-0106c0618527/inc/event_names.txt">event_names.txt</a>
